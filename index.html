In junior high school I was an active member of the OSIS, I also took part in social studies subject competitions.After junior high school I continued to SMK TELKOM Sidoarjo, I took the test and was accepted. My hobbies are playing games and sport,beside that i am also enjoy coding. The first I know coding at SMK TELKOM Sidoarjo. At first I found it difficult but after a while I became interested in coding. That's all about me.
